## Restaurant project
Simple restaurant project using webpack and javascript only with some styling added into it.
I had alot of fun with this one. I made my website based off of home and couldn't help but get inspired by it.
This was also a great way to practice my DOM Manipulation since I haven't really been on par with it.

### Things I learned for this project:

- Used webpack to bundle my assets and scripts
- Learned how to use the '--watch' method instead of rerunning 'npm run build' script
- Finding a logical way to switch tabs using only JS
- Using webpacks source maps to find my errors
